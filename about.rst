I'm a software developer with interests in functional programming, free software, web, privacy and security in general. I'll record articles that I think might be useful for myself later or others.

This blog is fully made using following free/open source software.

* Hakyll - https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll
    A static site generator written in Haskell.

* Bootstrap - https://getbootstrap.com
    A CSS library for designing responsive websites.
