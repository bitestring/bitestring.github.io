I am a software developer with interests in distributed systems, functional programming and free/libre software in general. I write articles that are personally interesting to me on computing and programming in general.

This blog is fully made using following free/open source software.

* Hakyll - https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll
    A static site generator written in Haskell.

* Nix - https://nixos.org/
    A functional package manager (and OS) that offers declarative builds and reproducibility.
    
* Bootstrap - https://getbootstrap.com
    A CSS library for designing responsive websites.
